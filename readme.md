# Name in progress!
Still working on this one, eventually it will be some sort of spaceship-style game with controls too complicated for humans, then I'll train genetic algorithms to get good at it.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Base game systems
- [ ] Simple agents playing
- [ ] 3D-ify the engine and rounds take place in orbit around a planet
- [ ] update the agents to account for this
